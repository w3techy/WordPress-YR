"We require that all plugins are fully functional and ready to be used when submitted. When someone submits a plugin with the default readme and no customized or useful code, we assume they have accidentally uploaded a boilerplate version of their plugin, or are testing how the upload system works.\n"
"\n"
"If it was the former, please double check the zip you're trying to upload for review and resubmit.\n"

"If it was the latter, we ask you please not use our system for testing. It's harmful to the volunteers to make them sort out real plugins ready for reviews.\n"

"You're welcome to submit a different plugin, but we feel that this is a poor choice to submit. Also there are a handful of plugins out there that already handle this, it's preferred you use those instead.\n"

"<strong>Why these kinds of plugins are not accepted</strong>\n"
"\n"
"Script insertion plugins are amazing and powerful. They're also incredibly dangerous and require a high level understanding of sanitization, security, and usage. These are skills that take years to master. WordPress has a highly complicated tool to insert CSS, and it opts not to handle javascript because of the dangers. PHP is even more complicated.\n"
"\n"
"Besides the sanitization issues, allowing arbitrary script insertion leads to users adding scripts that are dangerous without knowing. Users will paste in just anything and your plugin can become the unwitting vector for hacks.\n"
"\n"
"This is why WordPress itself allows you to lock people out of being able to edit theme and plugin files directly (via DEFINES that are used by many managed hosts), but also has post-processing checks that verify the site will still function after any changes.\n"
"\n"
"Because of those reasons, unless a submission demonstrates a solid understanding of the security and usage issues out of the gate, we reject them.\n"
"\n"
"If you've gotten all the way down here and still think we should be hosting your code, we ask you <strong>not</strong> resubmit the plugin, and reply to this email instead."

"Your plugin has been rejected because we no longer accepting frameworks, boilerplates, and libraries as stand-alone plugins.\n"
"\n"
"<strong>What to do next</strong>\n"
"\n"
"If you feel this was in error, please reply to this email with your plugin attached as a zip and explain why you feel your plugin is not a library or boilerplate.\n"
"\n"
"Before you do so, we ask you take the time to read this email in it's entirety. We know it's hurtful to be told we will not host your code, and this particular subject can be contentious, especially because we used to allow library code.\n"
"\n"
"We have chosen not to delete all the existing libraries so we don't break people's sites. However due to a number of reasons (which we will explain below) we do not accepting any <strong>new</strong> ones.\n"
"\n"
"This has nothing to do with the quality or purpose of your code. Most of us on the team are fans of libraries and frameworks.\n"
"\n"
"<strong>Why these kinds of plugins are not accepted</strong>\n"
"\n"
"To explain the terminology here:\n"
"\n"
"- <strong>Framework/Boilerplate:</strong> a template from which more code can be built\n"
"- <strong>Library:</strong> requires other plugins or themes to edit themselves in order to be used\n"
"\n"
"We require that plugins be useful in and of themselves (even if only being a portal to an external service). This means that a plugin should either be installed and be fully functional, or it should have some administration panel.\n"
"\n"
"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/03/01/please-do-not-submit-frameworks/\n"
"\n"
"When a plugin requires either the plugin itself to be edited to work, or can only be used by writing code elsewhere, it ceases to have as much a benefit to end users and is more of a developer tool.\n"
"\n"
"While there are many benefits to frameworks and libraries, WordPress lacks any plugin dependency support at this time, which causes a host of issues.\n"
"\n"
"The parade of likely support issues include (but are not limited to):\n"
"\n"
"- not recognizing the need for the library or and thinking they've been hacked\n"
"- not properly forking the boilerplate and editing it in place, resulting in updates erasing code\n"
"- not recognizing the need for the library plugin, and thus deleting it (causing others to break)\n"
"- updating the library plugin separately from the dependent plugins, leading to breakage\n"
"- updating a dependent plugin without updating the library, leading to breakage\n"
"- different plugins requiring different versions of a library plugin without proper if-exists checks\n"
"- We feel that libraries should be packaged with each plugin (hopefully in a way that doesn't conflict with other plugins using the libraries). At least until core supports plugin dependencies. Frameworks, in and of themselves, have no place in our directory as they are non-functional templates.\n"

"If you've gotten all the way down here and still think we should be hosting your code, we ask you not resubmit the plugin, and reply to this email instead."
