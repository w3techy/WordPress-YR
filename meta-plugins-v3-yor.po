"**Review Process**\n"
"\n"
"Our volunteer team of reviewers endeavors to perform all reviews in a timely manner, we are unable to provide an exact date of when your plugin will be reviewed.\n"
"\n"
"We encourage all plugin authors to use [Plugin Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/) to ensure that most basic issues are resolved first.\n"
"Please note: Automated tools may have false positives, or may miss issues. Plugin Check and other tools cannot guarantee our reviewers won’t find an issue that requires fixing or clarification.\n"
"\n"
"Please refer to the [Plugin Submission page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/add/) for:\n"
"\n"
"* Up-to-date details of the currently review queue length and estimated times.\n"
"* Upload a new version of the plugin: In case you wish to update the files of your plugin submission before we begin with the review.\n"
"\n"
"**Guidelines**\n"
"\n"
"All plugins are required to abide by our Plugin Guidelines. Please ensure you have read and understand these.\n"
"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/\n"
"\n"
"A common issue encountered by plugin authors is that we require your accounts email address to remain operational, not to have autoresponders, and not mark our emails as spam.\n"
"To reduce the possibility of this affecting you, please ensure you add `plugins@wordpress.org` to your address book / contact list.\n"
"If you use an email forwarder, alias, or group mailing list, please ensure that address is added to the Allow list.\n"
"\n"
"**Other Questions or Concerns?**\n"

"<strong>What to do next</strong>\n"

"\n"
"1. Read this entire email. There is a lot of information, however it is all important.\n"

"\n"
"Under <strong>no</strong> circumstances should you resubmit the plugin with the new name. If your situation is approved, we will give you explicit directions on how to proceed. Please do not try to jump ahead. We need you to follow the directions carefully.\n"
"\n"
"<strong>If you DID NOT mean to rename…</strong>\n"
"\n"
"There is always a possibility you weren't trying to rename, and instead wanted to update your existing plugin. If that's the case, then you can ignore the rest of this email and instead just go ahead and update your plugin using Subversion (AKA SVN)\n"
"\n"
"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/how-to-use-subversion/\n"
"\n"
"We don't have the ability to do this for you, so you will have to re-learn SVN if you've forgotten\n"
"\n"
"<strong>Why Renames Are Problematic</strong>\n"
"\n"
"It's important you understand that we do not have the technical ability to rename plugin URLs once they've been approved. That's why, since 2017, we have made every reasonable effort to inform developers as to their plugin permalink before the review.\n"
"\n"
"This means the only way to enact something like a rename would be to close your plugin and have you submit a new one. There are significant costs in doing this:\n"
"\n"
"- Visitors will see your plugin is closed \"by author request\" and cannot be redirected to the new plugin.\n"
"- All existing links will point to the closed plugin. You will not have access to update ones outside your control, harming your SEO.\n"
"- Existing users cannot be automatically updated to the new plugin - the more users you have, the worse this will be.\n"
"- Users will leave angry 1-star reviews, feeling they've been abused/abandoned, and those reviews will not be removed.\n"
"- In addition, by asking for a re-submission of an existing plugin your account would be flagged in our system and all future requests will be refused. This would be your one and only chance to rename something.\n"
"\n"
"Due to those reasons, we recommend you instead change the plugin Display Name. The majority of users do not care what your permalink is, if they even notice. We do not require your plugin display name match your plugin permalink, so it would be perfectly acceptable to have the permalink 'jumprabbit-apis' but the display name \"Everyone Loves APIs.\"\n"
"\n"
"<strong>Accepted Reasons for renames</strong>\n"
"\n"
"Of course there are some perfectly valid reasons to ask for a rename, they include but are not limited to:\n"
"\n"
"- Trademark owners have come to light and demanded you change the permalink\n"
"- There is an egregious misspelling in your permalink that fundamentally changes the nature of the plugin\n"
"- A vulgarity exists in your plugin permalink\n"
"- Previously unknown legal issues require the change\n"
"- If your plugin does not meet any of those reasons, then you will have to explain why you should be an exception to policy.\n"
"\n"
"If, after reading this, you've decided you don't want to rename the permalink, you don't have to reply to this email. It's fine to just go back to your existing plugin and update it. On the other hand, if you do think your plugin should be renmamed, please reply to this email and explain your situation.\n"
"\n"
"Again, <strong>do not</strong> resubmit this plugin. Doing so will result in your account being suspended until you do talk to us about this."

"\n"
"- <strong>Framework/Boilerplate:</strong> a template from which more code can be built\n"
"- <strong>Library:</strong> requires other plugins or themes to edit themselves in order to be used\n"

"\n"
"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/03/01/please-do-not-submit-frameworks/\n"
"\n"
"When a plugin requires either the plugin itself to be edited to work, or can only be used by writing code elsewhere, it ceases to have as much a benefit to end users and is more of a developer tool.\n"
"\n"
"While there are many benefits to frameworks and libraries, WordPress lacks any plugin dependency support at this time, which causes a host of issues.\n"
"\n"
"The parade of likely support issues include (but are not limited to):\n"
"\n"
"- not recognizing the need for the library or and thinking they've been hacked\n"
"- not properly forking the boilerplate and editing it in place, resulting in updates erasing code\n"
"- not recognizing the need for the library plugin, and thus deleting it (causing others to break)\n"
"- updating the library plugin separately from the dependent plugins, leading to breakage\n"
"- updating a dependent plugin without updating the library, leading to breakage\n"
"- different plugins requiring different versions of a library plugin without proper if-exists checks\n"
"- We feel that libraries should be packaged with each plugin (hopefully in a way that doesn't conflict with other plugins using the libraries). At least until core supports plugin dependencies. Frameworks, in and of themselves, have no place in our directory as they are non-functional templates.\n"
