<strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comments-in-wordpress/">Built-in Comments</a></strong><br>Your blog is your home, and comments provide a space for your friends and followers to engage with your content. WordPress’s comment tools give you everything you need to be a forum for discussion and to moderate that discussion.
<strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/installing-wordpress-in-your-language/">Use WordPress in Your Language</a></strong><br>WordPress is available in more than 70 languages. If you or the person you’re building the website for would prefer to use WordPress in a language other than English, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/">that’s easy to do</a>.
<strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/media-library-screen/">Media Management</a></strong><br>They say a picture says a thousand words, which is why it’s important for you to be able to quickly and easily upload images and media to WordPress. Drag and drop your media into the uploader to add it to your website. Add alt text and captions, and insert images and galleries into your content. We’ve even added a few image editing tools you can have fun with.
<strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/">User Management</a></strong><br>Not everyone requires the same access to your website. Administrators manage the site, editors work with content, authors and contributors write that content, and subscribers have a profile that they can manage. This lets you have a variety of contributors to your website, and let others simply be part of your community.
<strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">Extend with Plugins</a></strong><br>WordPress comes packed with a lot of features for every user. For every feature that’s not in WordPress core, there’s a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">plugin directory</a> with thousands of plugins. Add complex galleries, social networking, forums, social media widgets, spam protection, calendars, fine-tune controls for search engine optimization, and forms.
<strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">Easy Theme System</a></strong><br>WordPress comes bundled with three default themes, but if they aren’t for you there’s a theme directory with thousands of themes for you to create a beautiful website. None of those to your taste? Upload your own theme with the click of a button. It only takes a few seconds for you to give your website a complete makeover.
<strong>Add more design options to any block theme.</strong><br>Block theme authors can create unlimited individual color or font sets to offer more specific design options within the same theme. These sets provide more contained design possibilities, allowing for customization without changing the site’s broader styling, beyond color or typography settings.
<strong>Add the ability to customize content in synced patterns.</strong><br>Allow specific pieces of content to be customized in each instance of a synced pattern while keeping a consistent style for all instances, simplifying future updates. Currently, you can set overrides for Heading, Paragraph, Button, and Image blocks.
<strong>Application Framework</strong><br>If you want to build an application, WordPress can help with that too. WordPress provides a lot of the features under the hood that your app will need: translations, user management, HTTP requests, databases, URL routing and much, much more. You can also use our <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/">REST API</a> to interact with it.
<strong>Auto-update your plugins with peace of mind.</strong><br>Enjoy the ease of plugin auto-updates with the safety of rollbacks if anything goes wrong, improving your site&#039;s security while minimizing potential downtime.
<strong>Bonus</strong>: Preparations for WordPress’ 20th birthday
<strong>Community</strong><br>As the most popular open source CMS on the web, WordPress has a vibrant and supportive community. Ask a question on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/forums/">support forums</a> and get help from a volunteer, attend a <a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a> or Meetup to learn more about WordPress, read blogs posts and tutorials about WordPress. Community is at the heart of WordPress, making it what it is today.
<strong>Conflicting values for the constants %1$s and %2$s.</strong> The value of %2$s will be assumed to be your subdomain configuration setting.
<strong>Contribute</strong><br>You can be WordPress too! Help to build WordPress, answer questions on the support forums, write documentation, translate WordPress into your language, speak at a WordCamp, write about WordPress on your blog. Whatever your skill, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">we’d love to have you</a>!<br>
<strong>Could not find site %1$s.</strong> Searched for table %2$s in database %3$s. Is that right?
<strong>Custom Content Types</strong><br>WordPress comes with default content types, but for more flexibility you can add a few lines of code to create your own <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/post-types/">custom post types</a>, <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/taxonomies/">taxonomies</a>, and <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/metadata/">metadata</a>. Take WordPress in whatever direction you wish.
<strong>Database tables are missing.</strong> This means that your host&#8217;s database server is not running, WordPress was not installed properly, or someone deleted %s. You really should look at your database now.
<strong>Drive adoption of the new WordPress editor</strong> – Following WordPress 5.9, our focus will be driving user adoption by making full site editing (and its tools) easy to find and use.
<strong>Easy Installation and Upgrades</strong><br>WordPress has always been easy to install and upgrade. Plenty of web hosts offer one-click <a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/automated-installation/">WordPress installers</a> that let you install WordPress with, well, just one click! Or, if you’re happy using an FTP program, you can create a database, upload WordPress using FTP, and run the installer.

<strong>Flexibility</strong><br>With WordPress, you can create any type of website you want: a personal blog or website, a photoblog, a business website, a professional portfolio, a government website, a magazine or news website, an online community, even a network of websites. You can make your website beautiful with themes, and extend it with plugins. You can even build your very own application.
<strong>For the CMS</strong>
<strong>For the CMS</strong> – Get high quality feedback, ensure actionable tickets come from the feedback with collaboration from design as needed, and ship code that solves our users’ most pressing needs.
<strong>For the Community</strong>
<strong>For the Community</strong> – Share our knowledge and resources in a way that inspires and motivates our users to action.
<strong>For the Ecosystem</strong>
<strong>For the Ecosystem</strong> – Prioritize full site editing tools and content across the ecosystem for all users.
<strong>Freedom</strong><br>WordPress is licensed under the GPL which was created to protect your freedoms. You are free to use WordPress in any way you choose: install it, use it, modify it, distribute it. Software freedom is the foundation that WordPress is built on.
<strong>Full Standards Compliance</strong><br>Every piece of WordPress generated code is in full compliance with the standards set by the W3C. This means that your website will work in today’s browser, while maintaining forward compatibility with the next generation of browser. Your website is a beautiful thing, now and in the future.
<strong>Hint:</strong> You can delete all builds which are not intended for release.
<strong>How</strong>
<strong>Importers</strong><br>Using blog or website software that you aren’t happy with? Running your blog on a hosted service that’s about to shut down? WordPress comes with importers for Blogger, LiveJournal, Movable Type, TypePad, Tumblr, and WordPress. If you’re ready to make the move, <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/importing-content/">we’ve made it easy for you</a>.
<strong>Open Source stewards</strong>: Iterate on WordPress’ open source methodologies to guide and sustain long term success for WordPress as well as the overall open source community that we are part of.
<strong>Own Your Data</strong><br>Hosted services come and go. If you’ve ever used a service that disappeared, you know how traumatic that can be. If you’ve ever seen adverts appear on your website, you’ve probably been pretty annoyed. Using WordPress means no one has access to your content. Own your data, all of it — your website, your content, your data.
<strong>Please, do not post support requests here!</strong> They will probably be ignored.
<strong>Plugin System</strong><br>The <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/">WordPress APIs</a> make it possible for you to create plugins to extend WordPress. WordPress’s extensibility lies in the thousands of hooks at your disposal. Once you’ve created your plugin, we’ve even got a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">plugin repository</a> for you to host it on.
<strong>Publish with Ease</strong><br>If you’ve ever created a document, you’re already a whizz at creating content with WordPress. You can create Posts and Pages, format them easily, insert media, and with the click of a button your content is live and on the web.
<strong>Publishing Tools</strong><br>WordPress makes it easy for you to manage your content. Create drafts, schedule publication, and look at your post revisions. Make your content public or private, and secure posts and pages with a password.
<strong>Search Engine Optimized</strong><br>WordPress is optimized for search engines right out of the box. For more fine-grained SEO control, there are plenty of <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/seo/">SEO plugins</a> to take care of that for you.
<strong>Simplicity</strong><br>Simplicity makes it possible for you to get online and get publishing, quickly. Nothing should get in the way of you getting your website up and your content out there. WordPress is built to make that happen.
<strong>Simplify your workflow with a new layout built for pages.&nbsp;</strong><br>See all of your pages and a preview of any selected page before you edit via a new side-by-side layout in the Site Editor.
<strong>Snow Patrol</strong>
<strong>Support open source alternatives for all site-building necessities</strong> – Provide access to open source elements needed to get a site up and running.
<strong>Theme System</strong><br>Create WordPress themes for clients, other WordPress users, or yourself. WordPress provides the extensibility to <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/">create themes</a> as simple or as complex as you wish. If you want to give your theme away for free you can give it to users in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">theme repository</a>.

A major WordPress version is dictated by the first two sequences. For example, 3.5 is a major release, as is 3.6, 3.7, or 4.0. There isn&#8217;t a &#8220;WordPress 3&#8221; or &#8220;WordPress 4&#8221; and each major release is referred to by its numbering, e.g., &#8220;WordPress 3.9.&#8221;

A minor WordPress version is dictated by the third sequence. Version 3.5.1 is a minor release, as is 3.4.2%s.

It is a fundamental unit of content in web design and is typically composed of a group of related sentences or thoughts focused on a particular topic or idea.

In terms of formatting, paragraphs in websites are commonly denoted by a vertical gap or indentation between each block of text. This visual separation helps visually distinguish one paragraph from another, creating a clear and organized layout that guides the reader through the content smoothly.

After discussions with <a href="%1$s">Mike Little</a>, <a href="%2$s">Matt Mullenweg</a> created <a href="%3$s">a new branch of b2</a> on SourceForge, and, with the name coined by his friend <a href="%4$s">Christine Tremoulet</a>, called it WordPress. WordPress.org launched May 27. Initially, it was home to the development blog, some schematic documentation, and support forums. The <a href="%5$s">original WordPress homepage</a> told the world that “WordPress is a semantic personal publishing platform with a focus on aesthetics, web standards, and usability.” The site gave the WordPress community a presence and the forums provided a home.

Also in February 2021, <a href="%s">W3Techs.com reported</a> the WordPress software now powers 40%% of the top 10 million websites in the world! Every two minutes, a new website using WordPress says, “Hello world”!
Also in May 2004, the first plugin, which is still bundled with WordPress — the <a href="%s">Hello Dolly plugin</a>, randomly displays a lyric from the Louis Armstrong song <em>Hello, Dolly!</em> in the top right of the admin dashboard was launched. It was intended as a guide for developers interested in making plugins, and for users learning how to activate or deactivate plugins.

As WordPress’ market share continued to grow, so did the amount of downloads from the plugin directory. WordPress was capable of building almost any type of website you could think of, and there were many smart people who jumped on board to build plugins, both free and premium. It was largely this rise of the WordPress entrepreneur that sent the download count over 1 billion in August, 2015.

As an example, the WordPress core team noticed before the release of WordPress 2.3 that the function %s was being misused by most theme authors, who were not escaping the function&#8217;s output for use in HTML. In a very rare case of slightly breaking backward compatibility, the function&#8217;s output was changed in WordPress 2.3 to be pre-escaped.
As of %1$s, WordPress %2$s has been downloaded over %3$s times - watch that number increase in real time!
As of %1$s, WordPress %2$s was downloaded over %3$s times.
As requested by %1$s on %2$s, %3$s has been closed in the WordPress Plugin Directory.

Closing your plugin is intended to be a permanent action. You will not be able to reopen it without contacting the plugins team.

If you believe this closure to be in error, please email %4$s and explain why you feel your plugin should be re-opened.

As the most popular open source CMS on the web, WordPress has a vibrant and supportive community. Ask a question on the <a href="%1$s">support forums</a> and get help from a volunteer, attend a <a href="%2$s">WordCamp</a> or Meetup to learn more about WordPress, read blogs posts and tutorials about WordPress. Community is at the heart of WordPress, making it what it is today.

At the core of the WordPress philosophy is our commitment to the open web and to building software that works for everyone, from a new user to an advanced developer. Our philosophy pushes WordPress to remain flexible, adaptable, and easy-to-use. Learn about WordPress&#8217;s philosophy and how it shapes our community.
At the start of March 2005, <a href="%1$s">WordPress v1.5 “Strayhorn”</a> had seen <a href="%2$s">50,000 downloads</a>. Just three weeks later, the number doubled to 100,000. To celebrate the landmark, there was a 100k party in San Francisco. On March 22nd, a group of WordPressers got together at the Odeon Bar in San Francisco.
At this time, we are not accepting plugins of this nature.

While the directory is open for all secure, GPLv2 (or later) compatible plugins, we reserve the right to reject any plugin on any grounds we feel are reasonable, whether or not they are explicitly noted in the guidelines.

<strong>What to do next</strong>

We know that being told we won't host your code is hurtful, and we ask you please read this email in full.

If, at the end, you feel this decision was in error, please reply to this email with your plugin attached as a zip and explain why you feel your plugin should be accepted.

<strong>Why these kinds of plugins are not accepted</strong>

Plugins that reproduce features that are already included in WordPress, without any perceivable additions, such as (but not limited to) duplication of existing short codes ( [embed] and [gallery] ), widgets (rss feed display), or functionality (adding users), will not be accepted.

We do not permit plugins that we feel to be unethical, such as black or grey hat SEO (including plugins that auto post content). Any plugin related to claims like 'Our plugin will help you earn thousands of dollars' will be rejected, as that behavior is scummy and unwelcome.

We also do not accept 'translation' plugins, or copies of plugins that are in another language, as that need is best served by communicating with the original plugin. Please reach out to them and provide a translation properly.

Plugins with obfuscated (i.e. hidden or encrypted) code will never be accepted.

If you've gotten all the way down here and still think we should be hosting your code, we ask you not resubmit the plugin, and reply to this email instead.

Big upgrades to the editor. With the release of <a href="%s">WordPress v5.0 “Bebo”</a> in 2018, Gutenberg became the default editing experience. The new block-based editor was the first step toward an exciting new future. Whether you were building your first site, revamping your blog, or writing code for a living; Gutenberg offered more content flexibility.

Blocks allow you to build your own custom posts and pages without any coding knowledge. Here’s a selection of the default blocks included with Gutenberg:
Blocks are the visual foundation of WordPress, and can be used to create and manage every part of your site. They&#039;re also easier than you think. Learn how to edit a block and you learn how to use all of WordPress—without having to write code. For inspiration, check out what others have done with WordPress in the Showcase.

Deadlines are not arbitrary
Deadlines are not arbitrary, they&#8217;re a promise we make to ourselves and our users that helps us rein in the endless possibilities of things that could be a part of every release. We aspire to release three major versions a year because through trial and error we&#8217;ve found that to be a good balance between getting cool stuff in each release and not so much that we end up breaking more than we add.

Each WordPress release cycle is led by one or more of the core WordPress developers. A release cycle usually lasts around 4 months from the initial scoping meeting to launch of the version.
Each block comes with its own set of controls for changing things like color, width, and alignment. These will show and hide automatically when you have a block selected.
Each font src must be a non-empty string.
Each plugin and theme has the ability to be continually developed by the plugin or theme owner, and any subsequent fixes or feature development can be uploaded to the repository and made available to users with that plugin or theme installed with a description of that change. Site administrators are notified of plugins which need to be updated via their administration dashboard.
Each project includes sub projects and newly-added sub projects.
Each security report is acknowledged upon receipt, and the team works to verify the vulnerability and determine its severity. If confirmed, the security team then plans for a patch to fix the problem which can be committed to an upcoming release of the WordPress software or it can be pushed as an immediate security release, depending on the severity of the issue.
Each webfont src must be a non-empty string.

Every piece of WordPress generated code is in full compliance with the standards set by the W3C. This means that your website will work in today&#8217;s browser, while maintaining forward compatibility with the next generation of browser. Your website is a beautiful thing, now and in the future.
Every piece of your site comes with a library of information and data—now, you can find what you need quickly and organize it however you like. Data views for pages, templates, patterns, and template parts let you see data in a table or grid view, with the option to toggle fields and make bulk changes.
Every release is committed to making WordPress accessible to everyone. 6.4 brings List View improvements and aria-label support for the Navigation block, among other highlights. The admin user interface includes enhancements to button placements, “Add New” menu items context, and Site Health spoken messages.
Everything you need to set up your site just the way you want it.

February 17, 2005
February 17th, 2021 marked the 100th release of Gutenberg, and while that looks remarkable on the outside, the release itself holds what all the other releases did. It holds improvements to existing features, it fixes bugs that users reported, it adds new features, and it highlights experiments with new ideas. What is remarkable about the release is the people. The ones who were with us from the start, the ones who were with us but left, the ones who joined in our journey, everyone who helped along the way, everyone who provided feedback, everyone who got their hands dirty, and everyone who has used this editor, tried to extend it, and provided ideas.

For 2022 the project has some big picture goals, as outlined in <a href="%s">this post</a>:
For All
For an immediate security release, an advisory is published by the Security Team to the WordPress.org News site%s announcing the release and detailing the changes. Credit for the responsible disclosure of a vulnerability is given in the advisory to encourage and reinforce continued responsible reporting in the future.
For anyone comfortable getting their own hosting and domain.
For anyone looking for the simplest way to start.
For detailed PHP extension recommendations, see the <a href="%s">Hosting Handbook</a>.
For detailed PHP extension recommendations, see the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/handbook/server-environment/">Hosting Handbook</a>.
For developers building client sites, you could now create reusable blocks, letting your clients add new content anytime, while still maintaining a consistent look and feel. A wide collection of APIs and interface components made it easy to create blocks with intuitive controls. Utilizing these components not only sped up development work but also provided a more consistent, usable, and accessible interface.
For developers, we&#8217;ve got lots of goodies packed under the hood that you can use to extend WordPress in whatever direction takes your fancy.
For developers, we’ve got lots of goodies packed under the hood that you can use to extend WordPress in whatever direction takes your fancy.
For example, 8 for wordpress.org/news, 719 for developer.wordpress.org/news
For example, if you are creating a recipe pattern, you use "Recipe Title", "Recipe Description", etc.
For help getting started, check out our <a href="%s">Documentation and Support Forums</a>.
For help with installing or using WordPress, consult our documentation in your language.
For more information on the planned release schedule, please read the Make WordPress Core post about the <a href="%s">proposed major release timing for 2022</a>.
For plugin vulnerabilities, <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/plugin-security/reporting-plugin-security-issues/">report it to the plugin developer and the plugins team</a>.
For the top 1000 sites, the market share is even higher at 51.8%. Over the past 10 years, the growth rate has increased, which is reflected by the fact that 66.2% of all new websites use WordPress!
For theme vulnerabilities, <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/theme-security/theme-security-issues/">report it to the theme developer and the theme review team</a>.
For various reasons related to our WordPress trademark, we ask if you&#8217;re going to start a site about WordPress or related to it that you <strong>not</strong> use &#8220;WordPress&#8221; in the domain name.

Also, many users have told us they find it confusing.

Hosted services come and go. If you&#8217;ve ever used a service that disappeared, you know how traumatic that can be. If you&#8217;ve ever seen adverts appear on your website, you&#8217;ve probably been pretty annoyed. Using WordPress means no one has access to your content.

WordPress has a built-in feature that detects when a plugin or theme causes a fatal error on your site, and notifies you with this automated email.
###CAUSE###
First, visit your website (###SITEURL###) and check for any visible issues. Next, visit the page where the error was caught (###PAGEURL###) and check for any visible issues.

###SUPPORT###

If your site appears broken and you can't access your dashboard normally, WordPress now has a special "recovery mode". This lets you safely login to your dashboard and investigate further.

###LINK###

To keep your site safe, this link will expire in ###EXPIRES###. Don't worry about that, though: a new link will be emailed to you if the error occurs again after it expires.

When seeking help with this issue, you may be asked for some of the following information:

If necessary, the core team may decide to fork or replace critical external components, such as when the SWFUpload library was officially replaced by the Plupload library in 3.5.2, and a secure fork of SWFUpload was made available by the security team<%s for those plugins who continued to use SWFUpload in the short-term.
If the WordPress version you want to use isn&#8217;t tagged enter <a href="%s">a revision number</a> here to get the right files.
If the value is a string, the value will be used as the archive slug. If the value is false the post type has no archive.
If there are any Custom Post Types registered at your site, the Content block can display the contents of those entries as well.
If they&#8217;re not WordPress.com, WordPress.net, WordPress.org, WordPress.tv, or WordPressFoundation.org, they&#8217;re not allowed, and you should contact the owner with a pointer to this page.

In 2019, Matt Mullenweg held a moment of silence for long-time community member <a href="%s">Alex Mills (viper007bond)</a> who passed away after a long-fought battle with leukemia. Alex was a very kind, creative, and prolific WordPress contributor.
In 2019, Matt Mullenweg’s annual State of The Word presentation was beautifully written and designed completely in Gutenberg for the first time ever.
In 2020, the <a href="%s">WordPress 5.6 “Simone”</a> release came from the first all-women and non-binary identifying release squad. WordPress 5.6 brought countless ways to set ideas free and bring them to life.
In 2021, the <a href="%s">TT1 Blocks theme</a> was released as an experimental block-based version of the Twenty Twenty-One theme. It’s been created to leverage full-site editing functionality that is being built in the Gutenberg plugin. Not meant for use on a production site yet.
In February 2005, the theme system was built using PHP, which is a templating language itself, after all. The theme system breaks a theme down into its component parts — header, footer, and sidebar, for example. Each part is an individual file that a designer can customize. A native WordPress theme system, as opposed to a templating system such as Smarty, meant that designers could design and build themes without learning an entirely new syntax.
In January 2013, <a href="%s">Ben Dunkle proposed new, flat icons</a>. The WordPress admin was outdated, particularly on retina displays where the icons were pixelated. Flat icons would scale properly and also allow designers to color icons using CSS. So the MP6 design project began to address icons and other improvements. Work took place in a plugin hosted by the WordPress plugin directory. Anyone could install the plugin and see the changes in their admin. Every week, the group shared a release and a report that was open to public feedback.
In July 2006, Matt Mullenweg announced that he would host a BarCamp-style event called <a href="%1$s">“WordCamp”</a> later that summer in San Francisco. “BarCamp-style” was a code phrase for ‘last minute,’ <a href="%1$s">he joked</a>.
In March 2004, the <a href="%1$s">plugin system</a> transformed WordPress for core developers and the wider community. It meant that the core product didn’t need to include every developer’s pet feature, just the features that made sense for a majority of users. Ryan Boren <a href="%2$s">stated</a> that the plugin system enabled core developers to implement the 80/20 rule: “Is this useful to 80%% of our users? If not, try it in a plugin.”
In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing.
In addition to more than 50 trusted experts, including lead developers, security researchers, and key contributors to every component of WordPress, <a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/">sponsored members of the Security Team</a> dedicate time to identifying and addressing concerns in the software and ecosystem.

In late 2003, major changes to the file structure involved replacing “b2” files with “wp-”, dubbed <a href="%s">The Great Renaming</a>. The WordPress file structure morphed from b2 to the familiar file structure used today, with many files consolidated into the wp-includes and wp-admin folders.
In memory of <a href="%s">Kim Parsell</a>, in 2015 the WordPress Foundation created a scholarship to provide annual funding for a woman of any assigned sex, who contributes to WordPress, to attend WordCamp US.
In past releases we&#8217;ve taken major steps to improve ease of use and ultimately make things simpler to understand. One great example of this is core software updates. Updating used to be a painful manual task that was too tricky for a lot of our users. We decided to focus on this and simplified it down to a single click. Now anyone with a WordPress installation can perform one click upgrades on both the core of WordPress and plugins and themes.

Maintenance
Major releases may add new user features and developer APIs. Though typically in the software world, a &#8220;major&#8221; version means you can break backwards compatibility, WordPress strives to never break backwards compatibility. Backwards compatibility is one of the project&#8217;s most important philosophies, with the aim of making updates much easier on users and developers alike.

Many end users of WordPress are non-technically minded. They don&#8217;t know what AJAX is, nor do they care about which version of PHP they are using. The average WordPress user simply wants to be able to write without problems or interruption. These are the users that we design the software for as they are ultimately the ones who are going to spend the most time using it for what it was built for.

Matt Mullenweg announced his plans to overhaul the editor during his <a href="%1$s">State of the Word address in 2016</a>. More specifically, he talked about creating a “block-based editor” and reiterated that it was important to continue learning JavaScript deeply. Not long after, the project was given a name, Gutenberg. The <a href="%2$s">first commit</a> occurred Feb 3, 2017 and the <a href="%3$s">first release</a> as a WordPress plugin in June 2017. Initially, Gutenberg was met with a bit of controversy, but the entire WordPress community rallied around the project to help ensure its success.

Obviously there are those who will try to get around these ideals and restrict the freedom of their users by trying to find loopholes or somehow circumvent the intention of the WordPress licensing, which is to ensure freedom of use. We believe that the community as a whole will reward those who focus on supporting these licensing freedoms instead of trying to avoid them.

On May 13th, 2004, Six Apart, the company behind Movable Type, <a href="%1$s">announced changes to Movable Type’s license</a>. Movable Type 3.0, the newest version, came with licensing restrictions, which meant that users not only had to pay for software that was previously free but pay for each additional software installation. Six Apart’s move galvanized the WordPress community. It helped grow the WordPress platform. <a href="%2$s">WordPress downloads on SourceForge more than doubled</a>, increasing from 8,670 in April, 2004, to 19,400 in May.
On May 27th, 2003, <a href="%s">the first version of WordPress, WordPress 0.7, was released</a>. Users who switched from b2 to WordPress got some new features, most notably the new, simplified administration panel and the WordPress Links Manager, which allowed users to create a blogroll. Once WordPress 0.7 shipped, there was an effort to get other developers involved in the project, starting with Donncha Ó Caoimh and François Planque, both of whom had created their own b2 forks.
On WordCamp.org sites, banking/financial data collected as part of a reimbursement request is deleted from WordCamp.org 7 days after the request is marked paid. The reason for the 7-day retention period is to prevent organizers having to re-enter their banking details if a wire fails or if a payment was marked &#8220;Paid&#8221; in error. Invoices and receipts related to WordCamp expenses are retained for 7 years after the close of the calendar year&#8217;s audit, by instruction of our financial consultants (auditors & bookkeepers).

Personalize blocks
Phase 1 was the new block editor, <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/">Gutenberg</a>, released in WordPress 5.0. In 2021 and 2022, we focused on merging Site Editing (Phase 2) into WordPress. This introduced the Site Editor and a suite of editing capabilities that enable leveraging blocks for use across an entire website. Phase 3 is Collaborative Editing, also known as Workflows given its implementation of features for workflows and real-time collaboration. <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features/">Check out the Feature Projects Overview page</a> for more information on site editing, its components, and other active feature work.
Phase 1: Planning and securing team leads. This is done in the #core chat room on Slack. The release lead discusses features for the next release of WordPress. WordPress contributors get involved with that discussion. The release lead will identify team leads for each of the features.
Phase 2 of Gutenberg won’t be finished when it’s merged into WordPress. The work to gather feedback and iterate based on user needs will continue after WordPress 5.8 is released. As a reminder, these are the four phases outlined in the Gutenberg project:
Phase 2: Development work begins. Team leads assemble teams and work on their assigned features. Regular chats are scheduled to ensure the development keeps moving forward.
Phase 3: Beta. Betas are released, and beta-testers are asked to start reporting bugs. No more commits for new enhancements or feature requests are carried out from this phase on. Third-party plugin and theme authors are encouraged to test their code against the upcoming changes.
Phase 4: Release Candidate. There is a string freeze for translatable strings from this point on. Work is targeted on regressions and blockers only.
Phase 5: Launch. WordPress version is launched and made available in the WordPress Admin for updates.

Simplicity makes it possible for you to get online and get publishing, quickly. Nothing should get in the way of you getting your website up and your content out there. WordPress is built to make that happen.

Since its inception in 2003, WordPress has undergone continual hardening so its core software can address and mitigate common security threats, including the Top 10 list identified by The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) as common security vulnerabilities, which are discussed in this document.

So while we consider it really important to listen and respond to those who post feedback and voice their opinions on forums, they only represent a tiny fraction of our end users. When making decisions on how to move forward with future versions of WordPress, we look to engage more of those users who are not so vocal online. We do this by meeting and talking to users at WordCamps across the globe, this gives us a better balance of understanding and ultimately allows us to make better decisions for everyone moving forward.

That said, we can&#8217;t test every possible environment and <a href="%3$s">each of the hosts on our hosting page</a> supports the above and more with no problems.

The <a href="%1$s">Accessibility Handbook</a> shares the <a href="%2$s">best practices</a> for web accessibility, a list of <a href="%3$s">accessibility tools</a>, the <a href="%4$s">testing we do</a> to improve WordPress, themes, and plugins, and <a href="%5$s">how to get involved</a> in WordPress accessibility.
The <a href="%1$s">WordPress APIs</a> make it possible for you to create plugins to extend WordPress. WordPress&#8217;s extensibility lies in the thousands of hooks at your disposal. Once you&#8217;ve created your plugin, we&#8217;ve even got a <a href="%2$s">plugin repository</a> for you to host it on.
The <a href="%1$s">WordPress Plugin Repository</a> launched in January 2005. Hosted at <a href="%2$s">dev.wp-plugins.org</a>, and powered by subversion and trac, it’s quite different from the user-friendly plugin directory that we’re used to today. Literally, the plugin repository was just a code repository.
The <a href="%s">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0</a>, or ATAG, are a set of guidelines that govern how to create a tool for creating web pages that are both accessible and encourages the creation of accessible content.
The <a href="%s">WordPress Accessibility Team</a> provides accessibility expertise across the project to improve the accessibility of WordPress core and resources.
The <a href="%s">WordPress accessibility coding standards</a> require new or updated code to meet the standards of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.0 at level AA. ATAG conformance is an additional goal beyond WCAG compliance.
The <a href="%s">community was pleased</a> with decoupling WordPress the project from Automattic the company. It gave people more confidence that Automattic was not out to dominate the WordPress commercial ecosystem.
The <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/security/">Security guide in the Advanced Administration handbook</a> contains key information on how to secure your hosting environment.
The <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/">Security guide in the Common APIs handbook</a> is your go-to guide for secure development principles.
The <article> element should represent a self-contained, syndicatable portion of the document.
The <aside> element should represent a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the document's main content.
The <div> element should only be used if the block is a design element with no semantic meaning.
The <footer> element should represent a footer for its nearest sectioning element (e.g.: <section>, <article>, <main> etc.).
The <header> element should represent introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids.
The <main> element should be used for the primary content of your document only.
The <nav> element should be used to identify groups of links that are intended to be used for website or page content navigation.
The <section> element should represent a standalone portion of the document that can't be better represented by another element.
The Accessibility Team
The Cheshire Cat.
The Community
The Core Leadership Team consists of Matt Mullenweg, five lead developers, and more than a dozen core developers with permanent commit access. These developers have final authority on technical decisions, and lead architecture discussions and implementation efforts.
The DB ID of the nav_menu_item that is this item's menu parent, if any, otherwise 0.
The Database API%s, added in WordPress 0.71, provides the correct method for accessing data as named values which are stored in the database layer.
The Default Theme
The Details
The Edit Media screen is deprecated as of WordPress 6.3. Please use the Media Library instead.
The Filesystem API%1$s, added in WordPress 2.6%2$s, was originally created for WordPress&#8217; own automatic updates feature. The Filesystem API abstracts out the functionality needed for reading and writing local files to the filesystem to be done securely, on a variety of host types.
The Footer template defines a page area that typically contains site credits, social links, or any other combination of blocks.
The Four Phases of Gutenberg
The GD image library is not installed.
The GMT date the application password was created.
The GMT date the application password was last used.
The GNU Public License
The Great Renaming
The HTTP API%1$s, added in WordPress 2.7%2$s and extended further in WordPress 2.8, standardizes the HTTP requests for WordPress. The API handles cookies, gzip encoding and decoding, chunk decoding (if HTTP 1.1), and various other HTTP protocol implementations. The API standardizes requests, tests each method prior to sending, and, based on your server configuration, uses the appropriate method to make the request.
The Header template defines a page area that typically contains a title, logo, and main navigation.

The WordPress Core Application Programming Interface (API) is comprised of several individual APIs%s, each one covering the functions involved in, and use of, a given set of functionality. Together, these form the project interface which allows plugins and themes to interact with, alter, and extend WordPress core functionality safely and securely.
The WordPress Core Leadership Team
The WordPress Foundation was launched in January 2010. Automattic transferred <a href="%s">the trademarks</a> later that year in September. As part of the transfer, Automattic was granted use of WordPress for WordPress.com, but not for any future domains. Matt was granted a license for WordPress.org and WordPress.net. As well as transferring the trademarks for WordPress itself, the company also transferred the WordCamp name. As with WordPress itself, this protects WordCamps as non-profit, educational events in perpetuity.

The WordPress Security Team
The WordPress Security Team believes in Responsible Disclosure by alerting the security team immediately of any potential vulnerabilities. Potential security vulnerabilities can be signaled to the Security Team via the <a href="%1$s">WordPress HackerOne</a>%2$s. The Security Team communicates amongst itself via a private Slack channel, and works on a walled-off, private Trac for tracking, testing, and fixing bugs and security problems.
The WordPress Security Team is made up of approximately %1$s experts including lead developers and security researchers &mdash; about half are employees of Automattic (makers of WordPress.com, the earliest and largest WordPress hosting platform on the web), and a number work in the web security field. The team consults with well-known and trusted security researchers and hosting companies%2$s.
The WordPress Security Team often collaborates with other security teams to address issues in common dependencies, such as resolving the vulnerability in the PHP XML parser, used by the XML-RPC API that ships with WordPress, in WordPress 3.9.2%s. This vulnerability resolution was a result of a joint effort by both WordPress and Drupal security teams.
The WordPress Security Team works to identify and resolve security issues across the WordPress core software, harden the software against threats such as the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top Ten</a>, and <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/">provide guidance</a> across the ecosystem.
The WordPress Security Team, in collaboration with the WordPress Core Leadership Team and backed by the WordPress global community, works to identify and resolve security issues in the core software available for distribution and installation at WordPress.org, as well as recommending and documenting security best practices for third-party plugin and theme authors.

The core and contributing developers primarily guide WordPress development. Every version, hundreds of developers contribute code to WordPress. These core contributors are volunteers who contribute to the core codebase in some way.
The core of WordPress will always provide a solid array of basic features. It&#8217;s designed to be lean and fast and will always stay that way. We are constantly asked &#8220;when will X feature be built&#8221; or &#8220;why isn&#8217;t X plugin integrated into the core&#8221;. The rule of thumb is that the core should provide features that 80% or more of end users will actually appreciate and use. If the next version of WordPress comes with a feature that the majority of users immediately want to turn off, or think they&#8217;ll never use, then we&#8217;ve blown it. If we stick to the 80% principle then this should never happen.

The creation of a mark, created by <a href="%s">Jason Santa Maria</a>, gave WordPress a stand-alone element of the logo which, over time, would be recognizable even without the word beside it.

The decision to fork b2, not to rewrite the platform was prescient: if the community had buried itself in a rewrite, it wouldn’t have been ready to welcome and support all of the new WordPress users. Instead, they were ready. For weeks, everyone was focused on helping “switchers”. Developers wrote scripts to help people easily migrate from Movable Type to WordPress.

The default theme can serve as a starting point for custom theme development, and site developers can create a child theme which includes some customization but falls back on the default theme for most functionality and security. The default theme can be easily removed by an administrator if not needed.

The first en-masse, invitation-only WordPress community get-together — <a href="%s">The Community Summit</a> — took place in 2012. The Community Summit focused on issues facing WordPress software development and the wider WordPress community. Community members nominated themselves and others to receive an invitation; a team of 18 people reviewed and voted on who would be invited. The attendees — active contributors, bloggers, plugin and theme developers, and business owners from across the WordPress community — came to Tybee Island, Georgia, to talk about WordPress.
The first mailing list in the project, however, wasn’t wp-hackers, but wp-docs, which was <a href="%1$s">set up in November 2003</a> to discuss the WordPress documentation and wiki. It was active for six months before the <a href="%2$s">hackers mailing list</a> was set up in June 2004. This later moved to <a href="%3$s">wp-hackers</a> in 2005. Development discussion shifted from the forums to the mailing list, leaving the forums as a place to provide support.

The month prior to a release new features are frozen and the focus is entirely on ensuring the quality of the release by eliminating bugs and profiling the code for any performance issues.
The more frequent and regular releases are, the less important it is for any particular feature to be in this release. If it doesn&#8217;t make it for this one, it&#8217;ll just be a few months before the next one. When releases become unpredictable or few and far between, there&#8217;s more pressure to try and squeeze in that one more thing because it&#8217;s going to be so long before the next one.

The technology that powers much of the web has never been easier to learn. Blocks allow you to visually interact with any piece of content, with or without code—fueling rich layouts, interactive onboarding, and endless extensibility. As powerful for design as they are for development, but still intuitive enough for newcomers.

This email is to let you know that your plugin %1$s has been added to the Block Directory here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/block/.

We're still working on improving Block Directory search and automated detection of blocks, so don't be alarmed if your block isn't immediately visible there. We've built a new tool to help developers identify problems and potential improvements to block plugins, which you'll find here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/block-plugin-validator/.

In case you missed it, the Block Directory is a new feature coming to WordPress 5.5 in August. By having your plugin automatically added here, WordPress users will be able to discover your block plugin and install it directly from the editor when searching for blocks. If you have any feedback (bug, enhancement, etc) about this new feature, please open an issue here: https://github.com/wordpress/gutenberg/.

If you would like your plugin removed from the Block Directory, you can do so here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/block-plugin-validator/?plugin_url=%2$s

Otherwise, you're all set!

W3Techs.com broke the Internet down and divided it by each content management system in 2015. WordPress <a href="%1$s">far exceeded</a> number two on the list, which was Joomla at just 2.8 percent. Matt Mullenweg <a href="%2$s">wrote</a>, <em>“The big opportunity is still the 57%% of websites that don’t use any identifiable CMS yet, and that’s where I think there is still a ton of growth for us (and I’m also rooting for all the other open source CMSes).”.</em> He also <a href="%3$s">tweeted</a> just these few words, <em>“Seventy-Five to Go”.</em>
WHAT was he doing, the great god Pan,
	Down in the reeds by the river?
Spreading ruin and scattering ban,
Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat,
And breaking the golden lilies afloat
    With the dragon-fly on the river.

We also recommend either <a href="%1$s">Apache</a> or <a href="%2$s">Nginx</a> as the most robust options for running WordPress, but neither is required.
We also strongly recommend <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerability_Disclosure_Cheat_Sheet.html#receiving-vulnerability-reports">publishing a responsible disclosure policy</a> of your own.
We are able to do this because we have a very capable theme and plugin system and a fantastic developer community. Different people have different needs, and having the sheer number of quality WordPress plugins and themes allows users to customize their installations to their taste. That should allow all users to find the remaining 20% and make all WordPress features those they appreciate and use.
We believe great software should work with minimum set up, emphasizing accessibility, performance, security, and ease of use. The basic WordPress software is simple and predictable, offering powerful features for growth and success.
We believe in democratizing publishing and the <a href="%s">freedoms that come with open source</a>. Supporting this idea is a large community of people collaborating on and contributing to this project. The WordPress community is welcoming and inclusive. Our contributors&#8217; passion drives the success of WordPress which, in turn, helps you reach your goals.
We have rejected this plugin because it appears to be a demo or test version of a plugin.

<strong>What to do next</strong>

We know that being told we won't host your code is hurtful, and we ask you please read this email in full.

If, at the end, you feel this decision was in error, please reply to this email with your plugin attached as a zip and explain why you feel your plugin should be accepted.

<strong>Why these kinds of plugins are not accepted</strong>

We require that all plugins are fully functional and ready to be used when submitted. When someone submits a plugin with the default readme and no customized or useful code, we assume they have accidentally uploaded a boilerplate version of their plugin, or are testing how the upload system works.

If it was the former, please double check the zip you're trying to upload for review and resubmit.

If it was the latter, we ask you please not use our system for testing. It's harmful to the volunteers to make them sort out real plugins ready for reviews.

If you've gotten all the way down here and still think we should be hosting your code, we ask you <strong>not</strong> resubmit the plugin, and reply to this email instead.
We love to challenge ourselves and simplify tasks in ways that are positive for the overall WordPress user experience. Every version of WordPress should be easier and more enjoyable to use than the last.
We recommend servers running version %1$s or greater of <a href="%2$s">PHP</a> and <a href="%3$s">MySQL</a> version %4$s <em>OR</em> <a href="%5$s">MariaDB</a> version %6$s or greater.

We take the security of the WordPress project and the ecosystem seriously. With <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/history/">over 20 years of history</a> and powering more than [market_share] of the web, we&#039;re committed to ensuring security for all, from solo bloggers to enterprise organizations.
We use cookies for a number of different purposes. Some cookies are necessary for technical reasons; some enable a personalized experience for both visitors and registered users; and some allow the display of advertising from selected third party networks. Some of these cookies may be set when a page is loaded, or when a visitor takes a particular action (clicking the &#8216;like&#8217; or &#8216;follow&#8217; button on a post, for example).
We welcome the contributions of everyone who&#8217;s interested in joining the WordPress open source project, and every thriving, diverse community needs etiquette guidelines. Review our simple guidelines that focus on diversity, safety, and inclusion and foster a welcoming community for our contributors around the world.
We will not sell or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.
We will not use the information you provide when you register for an account, attend our events, receive newsletters, use certain other services, or participate in the WordPress open source project in any other way.
We will retain your personal information on our systems only for as long as we need to, for the success of the WordPress open source project and the programs that support WordPress.org. We keep contact information (such as mailing list information) until a user unsubscribes or requests that we delete that information from our live systems. If you choose to unsubscribe from a mailing list, we may keep certain limited information about you so that we may honor your request.
We work hard to make sure that every release is in keeping with this philosophy. We ask for as few technical details as possible during the setup process as well as providing full explanations of anything we do ask.
We would like to send you email marketing communication which may be of interest to you from time to time. If you have consented to marketing, you may opt out later.

When a plugin vulnerability is discovered by the WordPress Security Team, they contact the plugin author and work together to fix and release a secure version of the plugin. If there is a lack of response from the plugin author or if the vulnerability is severe, the plugin/theme is pulled from the public directory, and in some cases, fixed and updated directly by the Security Team.
When a security update is pushed for the current stable release of WordPress, the core team will also push security updates for all the releases that are capable of background updates (since WordPress 3.7), so these older but still recent versions of WordPress will receive security enhancements.

When making decisions these are the users we consider first. A great example of this consideration is software options. Every time you give a user an option, you are asking them to make a decision. When a user doesn&#8217;t care or understand the option this ultimately leads to frustration. As developers we sometimes feel that providing options for everything is a good thing, you can never have too many choices, right? Ultimately these choices end up being technical ones, choices that the average end user has no interest in. It&#8217;s our duty as developers to make smart design decisions and avoid putting the weight of technical choices on our end users.

With <a href="%s">WordPress v2.7 “Coltrane”</a> in 2008, the admin user interface changed drastically. When screenshots of the changes appeared on community blogs, the inevitable question was “why are they changing it again?” WordPress v2.5’s design hadn’t quite settled in before another huge change came about with the implementation in v2.7.
With <a href="%s">WordPress v2.9 “Carmen”</a> in 2009, you could just paste a URL on its own line and have it magically turn it into the proper embed code, with Oembed support for YouTube, Daily Motion, Blip.tv, Flickr, Hulu, Viddler, Qik, Revision3, Scribd, Google Video, Photobucket, PollDaddy, WordPress.tv, and more would follow in future releases.
With <a href="%s">WordPress v3.9 “Smith”</a> in 2014, updates to the visual editor improved speed, accessibility, and mobile support. You could now paste into the visual editor from your word processor without wasting time to clean up messy styling. With quicker access to crop and rotation tools, it was now much easier to edit images <em>while</em> editing posts. Also, it became possible to scale images directly in the editor, and galleries began to display a beautiful grid of images right in the editor, just like in a published post.
With <a href="%s">WordPress v4.0 “Benny”</a> in 2014, it became possible to explore uploads in a beautiful, endless grid. A new details preview made viewing and editing any amount of media in sequence a snap. Embedding became a visual experience, showing a true preview of embedded content (such as YouTube videos) saving time and adding confidence. Writing and editing became even smoother and more immersive. The editor would now expand to fit content as you write, and the formatting tools were now available at all times.
With <a href="%s">WordPress v5.5 “Eckstine”</a> in 2020,  it became easier than ever to find the block you need. The new block directory was now built right into the block editor, making it possible to install new block types without ever leaving the editor.
With <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/10/15/introducing-block-hooks-for-dynamic-blocks/">Block Hooks</a>, developers can automatically insert dynamic blocks at specific content locations, enriching the extensibility of block themes through plugins. While considered a developer tool, this feature is geared to respect your preferences and gives you complete control to add, dismiss, and customize auto-inserted blocks according to your needs.
With WordPress, you can create any type of website you want: a personal blog or website, a photoblog, a business website, a professional portfolio, a government website, a magazine or news website, an online community, even a network of websites. You can make your website beautiful with themes, and extend it with plugins. You can even build your very own application.
With a brand-new default theme as a canvas, and support for an ever-growing collection of blocks as brushes, it became possible to paint with words, pictures, sound, or rich embedded media.
With our famous 5-minute installation, setting up WordPress for the first time is simple. We’ve created a <a href="%1$s">handy guide</a> to see you through the installation process.
With over 500 new features and enhancements and more than 400 bug fixes, this release is packed with improvements to the WordPress experience.
With the release of <a href="%s">WordPress v2.1 “Ella”</a> in 2007, lossless XML import and export functionality made it easy to move content seamlessly between WordPress blogs. Also, it came with features like a new tabbed editor to switch between WYSIWYG and code editing mode while writing a post. Better internationalization and support for right-to-left languages. A new upload manager made it easier to manage pictures, video, and audio. It brought much cleaner code, and more.
With the release of <a href="%s">WordPress v4.7 “Vaughan”</a> in 2016, REST API endpoints were added for posts, comments, terms, users, meta, and settings. Content endpoints provided machine-readable external access to a WordPress site with a clear, standards-driven interface, paving the way for new and innovative methods of interacting with sites through plugins, themes, apps, and more.

WordCamp
WordCamp Europe, in 2013, was the first large-scale WordCamp to be held in Europe. By large-scale, we mean big. And by big, we mean awesome. This was a chance for the European WordPress community to gather together in the idyllic town of Leiden to geek-out, share experiences, do business, and most of all, talk WordPress.
WordCamp Ireland, organized by <a href="%1$s">Sabrina Kent</a> and <a href="%2$s">Katherine Nolan</a>, was the first WordPress event <a href="%3$s">to offer activities for kids ages 3-12</a>. Krishna De might be the first person to coin the term “<a href="%4$s">Kids Camp</a>.” More events for kids followed, as outlined by <a href="%5$s">this list</a>, which is current through 2019.

WordPress and Security
WordPress and the Journey to 40% of the Web
WordPress branch:
WordPress can be installed on a multitude of platforms. Though WordPress core software provides many provisions for operating a secure web application, which were covered in this document, the configuration of the operating system and the underlying web server hosting the software is equally important to keep the WordPress applications secure.
WordPress checks for proper authorization and permissions for any function level access requests prior to the action being executed. Access or visualization of administrative URLs, menus, and pages without proper authentication is tightly integrated with the authentication system to prevent access from unauthorized users.
WordPress combines simplicity for users and publishers with under-the-hood complexity for developers. Discover the features that come standard with WordPress, and extend what the platform can do with the thousands of plugins available.
WordPress combines simplicity for users and publishers with under-the-hood complexity for developers. This makes it flexible while still being easy-to-use. The following is a list of some of the features that come as standard with WordPress; however, there are literally thousands of plugins that extend what WordPress does, so the actual functionality is nearly limitless. You are also free to do whatever you like with the WordPress code, extend it or modify in any way or use it for commercial projects without any licensing fees. That is the beauty of free software, free refers not only to price but also the freedom to have complete control over it.
WordPress comes bundled with three default themes, but if they aren&#8217;t for you there&#8217;s a theme directory with thousands of themes for you to create a beautiful website. None of those to your taste? Upload your own theme with the click of a button. It only takes a few seconds for you to give your website a complete makeover.
WordPress comes packed with a lot of features for every user. For every feature that&#8217;s not in WordPress core, there&#8217;s a <a href="%s">plugin directory</a> with thousands of plugins. Add complex galleries, social networking, forums, social media widgets, spam protection, calendars, fine-tune controls for search engine optimization, and forms.
WordPress comes with default content types, but for more flexibility you can add a few lines of code to create your own <a href="%1$s">custom post types</a>, <a href="%2$s">taxonomies</a>, and <a href="%3$s">metadata</a>. Take WordPress in whatever direction you wish.
WordPress contributors work around the globe, and have dedicated countless hours to build a tool that democratizes publishing. WordPress is open source software that is both free and priceless.

Your plugin has been rejected because we are not accepting plugins of this nature in most cases.

<strong>What to do next</strong>

We understand it is hurtful to be told we will not host your code here and ask you please read this email carefully.

You're welcome to submit a different plugin, but we feel that this is a poor choice to submit. Also there are a handful of plugins out there that already handle this, it's preferred you use those instead.

If you have any questions, please reply to this email. Otherwise it's okay to just move on to something else.

If you feel we've made this decision in error, please reply with a copy of you code attached and explain why you think that is the case.

<strong>Why these kinds of plugins are not accepted</strong>

Script insertion plugins are amazing and powerful. They're also incredibly dangerous and require a high level understanding of sanitization, security, and usage. These are skills that take years to master. WordPress has a highly complicated tool to insert CSS, and it opts not to handle javascript because of the dangers. PHP is even more complicated.

Besides the sanitization issues, allowing arbitrary script insertion leads to users adding scripts that are dangerous without knowing. Users will paste in just anything and your plugin can become the unwitting vector for hacks.

This is why WordPress itself allows you to lock people out of being able to edit theme and plugin files directly (via DEFINES that are used by many managed hosts), but also has post-processing checks that verify the site will still function after any changes.

Because of those reasons, unless a submission demonstrates a solid understanding of the security and usage issues out of the gate, we reject them.

If you've gotten all the way down here and still think we should be hosting your code, we ask you <strong>not</strong> resubmit the plugin, and reply to this email instead.
Your plugin has been rejected because we do not currently accept plugins that are only wp-cli add-ons.

<strong>What to do next</strong>

We understand it is hurtful to be told we will not host your code here. This decision has nothing to do with the quality or purpose of your code, and is solely related to the fact that it is, in fact, a wp-cli add on.

We recommend you include this code in your existing plugin instead of as a separate add-on.

If you feel this was in error, please reply to this email with your plugin attached as a zip and explain why you feel your plugin should be hosted here.

Before you do so, we ask you take the time to read this email in it's entirety.

<strong>Why these kinds of plugins are not accepted</strong>

Plugins are required to have some interaction with the blog in a way that is either automatic (eg. activating the plugin allows it to run) or interactive (eg. a settings panel).

Command line plugins do not meet that criteria.

If you've gotten all the way down here and still think we should be hosting your code, we ask you <strong>not</strong> resubmit the plugin, and reply to this email instead.
Your plugin has been rejected because we do not currently accept storefront plugins.

<strong>What to do next</strong>

We understand it is hurtful to be told we will not host your code here. This decision has nothing to do with the quality or purpose of your code, and is solely related to the fact that it is, in fact, a storefront.

We recommend you host this on your own service, and make use of self-directed updates for your ongoing support and maintenance.

If you feel this was in error, please reply to this email with your plugin attached as a zip and explain why you feel your plugin should be hosted here.

Before you do so, we ask you take the time to read this email in it's entirety.

<strong>Why these kinds of plugins are not accepted</strong>

Plugins that serve to install plugins and themes from places other than WordPress.org are not permitted due to security and user confusion. Historically they have led to users not understanding from whom they acquired a plugin, and where they should go for help.

In addition, if there's a bad update pushed, WordPress is perceived as responsible for any negative outcome.

If you've gotten all the way down here and still think we should be hosting your code, we ask you not resubmit the plugin, and reply to this email instead.
Your plugin has been rejected because we no longer accepting frameworks, boilerplates, and libraries as stand-alone plugins.

<strong>What to do next</strong>

If you feel this was in error, please reply to this email with your plugin attached as a zip and explain why you feel your plugin is not a library or boilerplate.

Before you do so, we ask you take the time to read this email in it's entirety. We know it's hurtful to be told we will not host your code, and this particular subject can be contentious, especially because we used to allow library code.

We have chosen not to delete all the existing libraries so we don't break people's sites. However due to a number of reasons (which we will explain below) we do not accepting any <strong>new</strong> ones.

This has nothing to do with the quality or purpose of your code. Most of us on the team are fans of libraries and frameworks.

<strong>Why these kinds of plugins are not accepted</strong>

To explain the terminology here:

- <strong>Framework/Boilerplate:</strong> a template from which more code can be built
- <strong>Library:</strong> requires other plugins or themes to edit themselves in order to be used

We require that plugins be useful in and of themselves (even if only being a portal to an external service). This means that a plugin should either be installed and be fully functional, or it should have some administration panel.

https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2016/03/01/please-do-not-submit-frameworks/

When a plugin requires either the plugin itself to be edited to work, or can only be used by writing code elsewhere, it ceases to have as much a benefit to end users and is more of a developer tool.

While there are many benefits to frameworks and libraries, WordPress lacks any plugin dependency support at this time, which causes a host of issues.

The parade of likely support issues include (but are not limited to):

- not recognizing the need for the library or and thinking they've been hacked
- not properly forking the boilerplate and editing it in place, resulting in updates erasing code
- not recognizing the need for the library plugin, and thus deleting it (causing others to break)
- updating the library plugin separately from the dependent plugins, leading to breakage
- updating a dependent plugin without updating the library, leading to breakage
- different plugins requiring different versions of a library plugin without proper if-exists checks
- We feel that libraries should be packaged with each plugin (hopefully in a way that doesn't conflict with other plugins using the libraries). At least until core supports plugin dependencies. Frameworks, in and of themselves, have no place in our directory as they are non-functional templates.

If you've gotten all the way down here and still think we should be hosting your code, we ask you not resubmit the plugin, and reply to this email instead.
